### Hello there, I'm Benjamin 👋
Your friendly neighbourhood Web Developer!

### About Me: 

Well, I am still enroute to learning the art of web designing and this is me in my learning phase. So, here goes! 🤓

### 👨‍💻 Design & Development

I've always had creative ideas, I honestly thought about going into graphic design but I found love at first site with programming and hey, who says I can't bring out my creativity here?

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:

HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

A Section challenge from Dribble. 
<br>
It's basically a landing page for reviews but I've found it somewhat challenging and got stuck. Anyway, I've gotten some advise and I am researching ways to tackle the problem. Sure would be exciting when I finish this project. 

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with:

Mentorship; so far it's just been me, articles and videos (my friend who actually introduced me to programming is an App Developer) so it gets tricky at times for me.
<br> 
Connections; I want to build my contacts and make more connections in tech. If you're interested in being friends and sharing ideas and tackling problems together, hey, why not hit me up? 🤓
